        <h3>IMPORTANT!</h3>
        <p>This is in NO WAY how you are supposed to structure your JavaScript applications after this week.</p>
        <p>It's just a number of isolated HTML-files that link to each other (observe the spinner in the top left corner
            of your browser whenever you press a link).</p>
        <p>Next week you will learn how to create "single page applications" with only one index.html file, and a number
            of HTML snippets with corresponding JavaScript files. You will also see how content/data in these
            files can be reused among the different parts of you program.</p>

    <p>None of the exercises given day-1 involved the browser, so just make sure they are included in your github repo</p>
